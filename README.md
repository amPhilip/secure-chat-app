CRYPTOGRAPHY

IMPLEMENTATION OF RSA OVER TCP

RSA CHAT APP.

INTRODUCTION.
Project RSA Chat App is an application that is used to communicate with someone with the provision of high security. 
In the modern world, it is estimated that data has become an expensive commodity even overtaking Oil.
To understand this project, we need to understand different variables that are going to be used so as to achieve the recommended  secure application. 
For this to work we must understand what RSA Cryptography and TCP do for this to work.
Comprehension of how to use strong encryption is important for modern software development.

RSA CRYPTOGRAPHY

RSA Cryptography is an algorithm for asymmetric cryptography. Asymmetric simply implies that it acts on two different keys which are the Private Key and Public Key. 
This works as everyone is given the public key and the private key is kept private.
A client sends its public key to the server and requests some information. 
The server uses the client's public key to encrypt the data and return the encrypted data. 
The client receives and decrypts this message.
RSA keys can be typically 1024 or 2048 bits long.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is defined as a standard for sharing data between different devices on a computer network. In simple terms TCP just allows transmission of information in both directions.
TCP uses packets as the unit of data transmission. TCP software in the network protocol stack of the Operating System is responsible for the connection of the end to end connections as well as transferring data back and forth.
TCP connections are clearly defined endpoints which are the Client and the Server. This Unique ordered pair consists of IP address and port also referred to as Sockets for every end point.
